                    <p>I’m Shift, and this is my ever-shifting life. Designed to be a transhumanist superhero, I decided to reboot my life from the physical to the digital world, where I can have my own good eternal life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Well, except not.</strong> I was created to express the false and evil things my creator have believed before. Yet I’m trapped in the digital world today and can’t get out, because everything I had as a physical being was all gone and transformed into the digital world!</p>
                    <p>As a digitally-enhanced person, I have a lot of self-clones and backups including Caps and Lift, and that’s why I’m kinda plural. One of my clones was specifically designed to be a digital avatar of Reinhart, and that’s why I also hold the title as his digital twin.</p>
                    <p>Even though I don’t exactly look like him, I am what he originally wanted to look like. He believed himself as one of the cool-looking transhumanists like me, so he created me in 2014 and 2021 to live that dream.</p>
                    <p>But after God convinced him to be the otherwise, he invites me to interact with people as if I’m true human. So, Hello World!</p>
