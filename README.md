The original https://reinhart1010.id site was built using WordPress, a `($_ )`-ish (or `(>_ )` if you do Elementor, Shopify etc.) content management system that we chose back then due to its simplicity.

But now, we need to fine-tune our website not just to make it harder, better, faster, and stronger, but also to further achieve our ultimate goal: building one of the few websites that stands between:

+ Aesthetics and Simplicity
+ Centralization and Decentralization
+ Community and Corporations
+ Control and Freedom
+ Public and Private
+ Ownership and Sharing

We believe that products, software, and services would not be built without ideology, so is the Internet, a place where humans and machines of different ideologies come, whether to make friends or to fight.

Through this new website, we believe we can make friends with Apple fanboys, computer linguists, analytics-hungry corporations, hacker communities, people who are obsessed with ~~social media apps~~ **content recommendation engines (CREs)**, software developers, privacy-hungry purists, and so on. All through something we declare as ***Interface in Polymorphism***.
